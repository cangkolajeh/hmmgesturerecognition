A Matlab-based software allows to use separate discrete
hidden Markov models to classify activities/gestures using the
acceleration values of the motion sensor, typically placed on
the forearm at the wrist. The software acquires directly the
sensor data, visualizes data in real-time, and does real-time
classification (recognition) of gestures and visualization of
recognition likelihoods.
